              <p>This part of the project is supposed to act as a dictionary for words only used in the context of programming languages. To access information about languages
                  that share this feature, go to the "Languages" section. If there are any mistakes, check out the "Contributing" section. 
                  Consult the "Resources" section to access the sources used to generate this information. </p>

              <li><a><name>Weakly typed</name></a></br>Weakly typed languages are languages in which a variable of one datatype can be used as another datatype without explicit conversion (casting).
               The compiler or interpreter recognizes this and infers the meaning. This might be easier to type but can create problems if a variable is accidentally implicitly converted.</li>
              <li><a><name>Strongly typed</name></a></br>Strongly typed languages require explicit conversion for a variable between different datatypes. This is less error-prone 
              but more difficult to write as it can be difficult to keep track of the types of the variables being used.</li>
              <li><a><name>Statically typed</name></a></br> Languages that are statically typed are languages that check if the type of a variable fits the program while it is being 
              compiled. That means that possible errors concerning types come up at compile time. Java is an example of a statically typed language.</li>
              <li><a><name>Dynamically typed</name></a></br>Languages that share this feature perform type checking while being executed instead of doing this while being compiled.
              This can be more efficient as the variable type does not constantly have to be inferred but it is more prone to errors. Python, for example, is dynamically typed. </li>


              <li><a><name>Compiled</name></a></br> Languages that are compiled are translated into machine code prior to being run.
              A tool called a <i>compiler</i> goes through various stages to check the code for error and eventually turn in into an executable binary form 
              of the source code.This executable file can then only be run on computers with the same layout of the processing unit. Benefits of this include the fast execution of the file and the fact that once the program is compiled, 
            the actual written source code cannot be accessed anymore. In theory, any language could technically be compiled or interpreted, 
          but there are clear tendencies for individual languages. </li>
              <li><a><name>Interpreted</name></a></br> Languages that are interpreted are translated into machinecode while being run. An interpreter is used for this process. 
              Benefits are that the code can be send to people independent of their computer's architecture. A downside is that the execution is relatively slow as each line has to be 
            translated on the go. A language can work with both a compiler and an interpreter but there is usually one that is preferred for a specific language.</li>


              <li><a><name>Low-level</name></a> </br>A term used to describe programming languages that are closer to the computer architecture 
              than any human language. It is short for "low level of abstraction" This category is completely subjective and can only be used in 
              comparison with the "high level of abstraction" category. Programming languages that usually fall under this category are Assembly and machine code. </li>
              <li><a><name>High-level</name></a> </br>A term used to describe programming languages that are closer to human languages than 
              the instructions understood by the computer. It is short for "high level of abstraction". Programming languages that are a third- or higher-
              generational language fall under this category.</li>

              <li><a><name>First generation</name></a> </br>The first programming languages to be developed. This only includes machine code without using mnemonics. These instructions
                go to the CPU directly. It only consists of binary code and is extremely difficult to understand for humans. </li>
              <li><a><name>Second generation</name></a> </br> Assembly languages fall under this category. Second generation languages provide mnemmonics for 
              machine code instructions and are therefore slightly more understandable than first-generational programming languages. </li>
              <li><a><name>Third generation</name></a> </br> One step above second-generational programming languages are third-generational programming languages. These
              provide even more abstraction and use English words to simplify the source code. From here on, programming languages are commonly called "high-level". They were
              first developed with the introduction of the compiler in 1952 by Dr. Grace Hopper. To run such a programming language, a compiler is needed to translate the source 
               code into something understandable by a computer. Languages like COBOL, FORTRAN but also most general-purpose like Java, C or C++ fall under this category. </li>
              <li><a><name>Fourth generation</name></a></br> Fourth-generation languages provide an even higher level of abstraction than third-generation programming languages.
