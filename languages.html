                  <p> </br> This part of the project is supposed to provide an overview of different programming languages. Each language has a short excerpt on this page if you hover over it and you can access
                    more information by clicking the code. Many words used to talk about programming languages are defined under the "Attributes" section and can simply be accessed by clicking
                  there. Consult the "Resources" section to access the sources used to generate this information. </p>

                <p> <span class = "important">Assembly</span> is a first-generation programming language. It is very low-level and there is a strong connection between
                    the instructions and the way the computer operates. It is an umbrella term rather than one single language as different computers require different
                    Assembly languages. </br> </br> It does not have any type checks and is translated into machine code using something called <i>assembler</i>
                    . It is impractical to write code in Assembly, as each variable has to be loaded from 
                  the memory one by one. It is mainly used for low-level applications as well as debugging difficult programs. </p>

                <span class="important"> Java</span> is an object-oriented programming language. In addition, it is a general-purpose language. As the name suggests,
                it can be used for a variety of things. The fact that 89% of computers in the US run Java, shows how widely used this programming language is.
                Java is compiled into Java Bytecode which is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine. It is statically and strongly typed.

                  <span class = "important">Brainf***</span> is an esoteric programming language. There is no purpose to it except for the amusement of its users.
                  It has eight basic commands, < > : , . + - [ ] which are enough to make this language turing-complete. It was developed in 1983 with the intent of having 
                  the world's smallest compiler, being only 240 bytes large. The < and > commands, move the imaginary pointer, the - and + commands increment or decrement
                  the value at the pointer, . is used for output and , is used to receive input. [ and ] act as "jump" instructions.

                    <span class = "important">Scratch</span> is a block-coding programming language used mainly for teaching and learning programming concepts. It is available online
                    but a downloadable environment is also available. Scratch compiles to Scratch Intermediate Code and it is event driven. Since there are no error messages,
                    and the only data type is a number, it is untyped. Scratch has no real-word application as it can only be used to program things inside the Scratch environment.

                      <span class = "important">C</span> is a programming language that is widely used for applications in all situations. It is compiled and statically and strongly
                      typed. It is known for being relatively low-level compared to other programming languages as C features things like pointers that deal with memory management, 
                      something that other, similar, programming languages do not have.

                  <span class = "important">JavaScript</span> is a programming language that is, together with HTML and CSS, used mainly in web development. It is interpreted
                  and object-oriented. Almost all web pages on the internet are designed using JavaScript. JavaScript has a lot of different libraries and frameworks which
                  make JavaScript work in almost any situation. It intentionally shares a similar syntax as Java but these languages are two distinct programming languages.

                  <span class = "important">Rust</span> is a general-purpose programming language. It is statically and strongly typed. It is mainly used for low level applications, 
                  for which good performance is crucial. One benefit of using Rust is that it is extremely safe, meaning memory cannot accidentally be overwritten. It has a syntax that is
                  similar to that of C++. It is being sponsored by Mozilla which also uses it in its browser <i>Firefox</i>. Rust is compiled using the "cargo" tool. "Cargo" is
                  Rust's package manager and turns Rust into an executable file.
