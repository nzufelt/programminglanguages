          <h1>About.</h1>
          <p>This is an open-source project started by Liv MÃ¤rtens at Phillips Academy in 2019. I started this project to show that while the topic of programming languages might seem intimidating, it truly isn't! </p> 
          <p> Often the resources available for either programming languages or related topics are targeted at people who already have a solid grasp of Computer Science. I believe that this adds to the notion that Computer Science is unapproachable, difficult or only for nerds.
               My intention is to make the topic of programming languages understandable for everyone, ranging from people who may not know anything about programming (yet) to people who could use this as a place to look already familiar terms up again.</p>
